# Challenge B - git sha
In this challenge you will learn a new git skill. Every commit has a unique code, called a SHA. It looks like random numbers and letters. Every commit has a commit message, which means that every SHA has a message associated with it. The SHA will be 7 characters long.

Sometimes when working on projects you will need to find a specific commit. Finding code in a git repository is easy when it is named by a branch (ex: what was the last change on the `master` branch?). Other times you need to find the exact commit where a change happened. Instead of going to `White House` you have to find what is at `1600 Penselvania Avenue`.

Challenge B is going to have you find a commit message from a specific commit in a 7 year old world famous industry changing project I worked on in college. CIHSP ("chisp", can't remember what it stands for), a Yelp for Chapel Hill bathrooms. Ideally it will be the only public example of me writing php. If asked I will say that I was forced to do it for a grade.

## ANYWAY

### Note
I will tell you now that you could use GitHub and ctrl+f to find your answer, but I encourage you to only use bash and google.
