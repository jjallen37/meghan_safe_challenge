# meghan_safe_challenge
My friend Meghan is learning git and the command line. She is also cat-sitting for me this weekend. 

In my apartment is a safe that requires two keys. Inside is a very nice sour beer. Both keys are hidden in my apartment, and the location of these keys can be revealed by answering the two questions in this repository. 

The locations will be revealed by this nifty website I was correctly hoped existed https://cloakmy.org/. I'm planning to return on Sunday, but for dramatic flair it should be stated that these questions will dissappear in 7 days from the time of this README's commit. 

- If the safe is cracked upon my return this repo will be updated with Meghan's successful results (bonus points if she submits a MR with a picture)
- If it not, it will be updated with pictures of me enjoying said beer. Or I'll delete this repo, idk.

git clone https://github.com/jjallen37/meghan_safe_challenge.git

- **Searching my apartment for the keys doesn't count**
